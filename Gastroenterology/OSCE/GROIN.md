### 3) Groin Examination:

> Key Tips for inspection: 
> - **Point sign:** ask the patient to point you to where the lump is located in their groin.
> - **Inspection:** should be conducted for all possible sites of groin hernias (inguinal rings, scrotum and femoral canal) with comparison to the contralateral side.
> - **Inspection Comparison:** Always compare your findings with the contralateral side.
> - **Cough Impulse:** Never forget to inspect the **Cough Impulse**, though not all hernias are pulsatile on cough or straining.
> - If a lump is reducible then it's 100% a hernia.
> - Scrotal hernias are a 100% indirect inguinal hernias (inguinoscrotal).

> Key Tips for palpation: 
> - Find the pubic tubercle, if not easily palpable, then using the adductor longus muscle by flexing and abducting the thigh and ask the patient to adduct the thigh while you attempt to resist it with your left hand while finding its proximal attachment with your right hand.
> - The adductor longus muscle adducts the thigh at the hip joint, so opposing its action will render the muscle apparent to you, the proximal attachment of the adductor longus is the pubic tubercle.
> - Determine the lump in relation to it (above and medial or below and lateral) will make you able to identify the type of the hernia.

> Key Tips to differentiate hernias from other lumps: 

| Tool/D.D | Herniated bowel | Lipomas | Femoral/Illiac artery aneurysms - Saphena varix | Undescended testicles |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `By Inspection` | Spontaneously/Manually reducible or Non-reducible | Friable not reducible masses and moveable with the skin | Pulsatile mass | inguinal swelling |
| `By Palpation` | Cannot get over its surface, not fixed to the skin and reducible | Friable fluctuable regular well-defined fibrofatty surface | thrills | cystic swelling - soft or hard |
| `By Auscultation` | Bowel gargling sounds with frequency of 5-10 seconds each 2 minutes and incresed frequency in case of incarcerated hernias | No sounds | vascular bruits | - |
| `Transillumination` | - | lights up if cystic with clear fluid | - | lights up if cystic with translucent fluid |

#### Examination sequence: 
- [x] Wash your hands and glove up.
- [x] **Explain the procedure** to the patient in brief.
- [x] **Gain consent and request a chaperone** (if indicated).
- [x] **Position the patient**: initially in standing position (if possible).
- [x] **Adequate Exposure**: full exposure from the thigh to the upper abdomen.
- [x] **Point sign**: ask the patient to point where they have the lump.
- [x] **Inspection**: 
    for the lump, other obvious swellings in the groin (over inguinal rings and along the inguinal canal) and the scrotum and surgical scars of a previous surgery.
- [x] **Compare both sides by inspection**: inspect the contralateral side and compare both in mind.
- [x] **Cough Impulse**: ask the patient to cough away from you and **inspect the groin again comparing both sides**, look specifically for lump impulse on cough.
- [x]  **Palpation**: 
  * Palpate over a visible lump, if you detect any by using **the point sign** or **inspection**.
  * Ask the patient to cough and feel for cough impulse.
  * Palpate the area over the region of the pubic tubercle (**external ring site**).
  * Ask the patient to cough and feel for cough impulse.
  * Palpate the area along the **inguinal canal and the internal ring** for possible muscle defects.
  * Again, Ask the patient to cough and feel for cough impulse.
- [x] **Scrotum invagination test**: to confirm an indirect hernia, examine the external inguinal ring by invaginating the index finger into the scrotum and asking the patient to cough again or perform a valsalva maneuver.
- [x] **Auscultation**: ascultate over the lump for 2 minutes for intestinal gurgling sounds of frequency 5-10 seconds, increased sound frequency may indicate intestinal obstruction (incarcerated hernia), while bruits may indicate femoral aneurysms.
- [x] **Re-position the patient**: now in supine (recumbent) position.
- [x] **Is the lump Spontaneously Reducible ?**: by inspection, establish whether the lump is spontaneously reducible (as an effect of the changed direction of the gravitational force vector affecting the lump and decreased intraabdominal pressure).
  * **Direction of reducibility**: notice the direction in which the lump reduces.
  * **Inguinal occlusion test**: press 2 fingers over the internal inguinal ring at **the mid-inguinal point** and ask the patient to cough.
  * **Test Result**: if an impulse appears under your finger tip and the hernia 
- [x] **Is the lump Manually Reducible ?**: if the lump isn't spontaneously reducible, ask the patient to try to reduce it manually.
  * **Direction of reducibility**: notice the direction in which the patient reduces the hernia (if it's reducible) will give a clue to the type of the hernia whether a direct, indirect inguinal or femoral.
  * **Inguinal occlusion test**: press 2 fingers over the internal inguinal ring at **the mid-inguinal point** and ask the patient to cough.
- [x] **Not reducible ?**: an incarcerated hernia is usually red, tense and tender and is considered a medical emergency as the patient should be quickly evaluated for hernial repair surgery. 
- [x] **Locate the pubic tubercle**: locate it by finding the origin of the adductor longus muscle.
- [x] **Lump relation to the pubic tubercle**: after confirming that the mass is an actual hernia, determining its relation to the pubic tubercle will confirm its type.
  * **Inguinal** hernias are **medial** to the pubic tubercle and **above** the inguinal ligament.
    * **Indirect inguinal** hernia bulges through the internal ring along the inguinal canal and may extend to the scrotum.
    * **Direct inguinal** hernia forms at the site of muscle weakness in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and rarely extends to the scrotum.
  * **Femoral** hernias are **lateral** to the pubic tubercle and **below** the inguinal ligament.
- [x] **Auscultation**: can be performed again in the recumbent position to determine the presence of a bowel sac.

| Congenital hernias, which make up the majority of pediatric hernias, can be considered a developmental defect rather than an acquired weakness. During the normal course of development, the testes descend from the intra-abdominal space into the scrotum in the third trimester. Their descent is guided by the gubernaculum through an evagination of the peritoneum, which protrudes through the inguinal canal and becomes the processus vaginalis. Between 36 and 40 weeksâ€™ gestation, the processus vaginalis closes and eliminates the peritoneal opening at the internal inguinal ring. 14 Failure of the peritoneum to close results in a patent processus vaginalis (PPV). In preterm babies, indirect inguinal hernias as a result of PPV is very high (Fig. 37-10). However, overall, the risk of developing a symptomatic hernia during childhood in the presence of a known PPV is relatively low. | |

- Floor: medially by the pectineus and adductor longus muscles in the medial compartment of the thigh and laterally by the iliopsoas muscle descending from the abdomen.
- Apex: points inferiorly and is continuous with a fascial canal ( adductor canal ), which descends medially down the thigh and posteriorly through an aperture in the lower end of one of the largest of the adductor muscles in the thigh (the adductor magnus muscle) to open into the popliteal fossa behind the knee.
