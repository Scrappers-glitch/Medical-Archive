# Clinical Exposure #1

A couple of notes on my first clinical exposure to the cardiopulmonary system.

## 1) Pulmonary System
### Pulmonary Embolism: 

> ### Overview:

| Symptoms & Signs | Risk factors | Causes | Clinical Diagnosing | Lab. findings | Imaging & Special Examinations | 
|------------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Dyspnea** - **Respirophasic chest pain** - **Hemoptysis** - **Tachypnea** - **Tachycardia** - **Accentuated pulmonic component (S2-P)** | **Virchow's triad:** venous stasis (VTE/DVT/Mural-thrombus/AF) - injury to vessel wall (trauma/infarction/bone-fracture) - hypercoagulability states (drugs/thrombophilias) | Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) due to: **DVT** (Major surgeries - bedridden patients (> 3weeks) - Orthopedic surgeries) - **Trauma** - **Bone fractures** - **post-cardiac infarction (mural thrombus)** - **Atrial fibrillations (AF)** - **Hypercoagublility states** (medications - malignancy - Factor V Leiden (protein C deficiency) - thrombophilias - antiphospholipid syndrome) | Risk stratification using the clinical prediction score "**Well's Score**" | **EKG** (Abnormal in 70% of patients - Sinus tachycardia (commonest) - RV hypertrophy - RT axis deviation - RT bundle branch block - P-pulmonale) - **ABG**: (reveals acute respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation - Increase in arterial Po2 & alveolar-arterial difference due to the V/Q mismatch) - **Serum D-dimer (> 500 ng/ml - Made when there is still a clinical suspicion even after low pretest probability of PE or for assurance)** - **Serum Cardiac enzymes and BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide)** | **Chest radiograph** (Normal, but paradoxically positive due to hypoxia - Westermark sign - Hampton's hump) - **Helical contrast CT-PA** (_the gold standard diagnostic study_) - **V/Q lung scanning** (alternative to CT-PA) - **Venous thrombosis study** for DVT (trivial study) - _Pulmonary angiography_ (historical study - nowadays is only used during catheter directed therapy (directed thromboectomy)) |

> ### Clinical prediction score (Well's Score) for risk stratification of PE: N out of 

| Variable | points |
|----------|--------|
| Clinical symptoms & signs of DVT (leg swelling and tenderness) | 3.0 | 
| Not likely PE | 3.0 | 
| Immobilization for > 3 days or Surgery in previous 4 weeks (A risk factor for DVT/Venous-Stasis) | 1.5 |
| HR > 100 BPM (Heart strain due to pulmonary hypertension) | 1.5 | 
| Hemoptysis (Lung infarction) | 1.0 | 
| Active Cancer | 1.0 |
