# Clinical Exposure #1

A couple of notes on my first clinical exposure to the cardiopulmonary system.

## 1) Pulmonary System
### Pulmonary Embolism: 

> ### Overview:

| Symptoms & Signs | Risk factors | Causes | Clinical Diagnosing | Lab. findings | Imaging & Special Examinations | 
|------------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Dyspnea - Respirophasic chest pain - Hemoptysis - Tachypnea - Tachycardia - Accentuated pulmonic component (S2) | Virchow triad: `venous stasis (VTE/DVT/Mural-thrombus/AF)` - `injury to vessel wall (trauma/infarction/bone-fracture)` - `hypercoagulability states (drugs/thrombophilias)` | Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) due to: `DVT (Major surgeries - bedridden patients (> 3weeks) - Orthopedic surgeries)` - Trauma - Bone fractures - post-cardiac infarction (mural thrombus) - Atrial fibrillations (AF) - `Hypercoagublility states (medications - malignancy - Factor V Leiden (protein C deficiency) - thrombophilias - antiphospholipid syndrome)` | Risk stratification using the clinical prediction score "Well's Score" | 

> ### Clinical prediction score (Well's Score) for risk stratification of PE: N out of 

| Variable | points |
|----------|--------|
| Clinical symptoms & signs of DVT (leg swelling and tenderness) | 3.0 | 
| Not likely PE | 3.0 | 
| Immobilization for > 3 days or Surgery in previous 4 weeks (A risk factor for DVT/Venous-Stasis) | 1.5 |
| HR > 100 BPM (Heart strain due to pulmonary hypertension) | 1.5 | 
| Hemoptysis (Lung infarction) | 1.0 | 
| Active Cancer | 1.0 |
